### Git vs. GitHub
_Git and Github are both similar but they have small differences_  
**Git:**
* Git _doesn't_ need Github in order to function correctly.
* It's a version control that keeps "snapshots" of you code. What does this mean? This means that
it will keep your exact code saved.
* Git runs in the command line.
* Basic Git workflow:
    * There are folders that contain files.
        * Once git is initialized, it is called a repository.
    * You can edit files and save them while you work.
    * You can add files to the stage then commit them.  

**GitHub:**
* GitHub.com is the "cloud" where your work is saved on.
    * You work on a "local machine", cloud9.
* It keeps track of your snapshots or "commits".
* GitHub is a website where you can publish your repositories and collaborate with other people.
* Github _requires_ Git.
